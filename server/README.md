WE DON'T USE ORM - ITS AN EXTRA OVERHEAD TO THE APP WITHOUT ANY BENEFITS.
INSTEAD, USE SQL STORED PROCEDURE FOR FASTEST PERFORMANCE, EASIEST TRANSACTION, EASY TO MAINTAIN WITHOUT TOUCHING AND REBUILDING JS CODE
AND FAR MORE BENEFITS WITH STORED PROCEDURE LIKE IT CAN BE COMPILED, NATIVE STORED ... ETC.

!!!LIGHTING FAST!!! IF ITS NOT FAST ENOUGH, PLEASE CHECK YOUR STORED PROCEDURE AND OPTIMIZE IT!
